This project implements a production-ready machine learning pipeline that handles everything from data ingestion to model deployment.

## Architecture

The pipeline consists of several key components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Automated data collection from multiple sources
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transformation and feature extraction
3. **Model Training**: Distributed training with hyperparameter optimization
4. **Model Serving**: REST API for real-time predictions
5. **Monitoring**: Performance tracking and drift detection

## Technical Details

The core training loop uses a custom loss function:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda\|\theta\|_2^2
$$

Where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter and $\theta$ represents model weights.

## Sample Code

```python
from pipeline import DataProcessor, ModelTrainer

# Initialize components
processor = DataProcessor(config)
trainer = ModelTrainer(model_config)

# Run pipeline
data = processor.load_and_transform("data/raw")
model = trainer.train(data, epochs=100)

# Deploy
model.deploy(endpoint="production")
```

## Results

The pipeline achieved:
- 40% reduction in training time
- 99.9% uptime for model serving
- Automated retraining on data drift
