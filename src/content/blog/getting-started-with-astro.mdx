Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build fast websites using your favorite UI frameworks. In this post, we'll explore the key features that make Astro stand out.

## Why Astro?

Astro's key innovation is its **Islands Architecture**. This approach allows you to:

1. Ship zero JavaScript by default
2. Hydrate components only when needed
3. Use any UI framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)

## Code Example

Here's a simple Astro component:

```astro
---
// This runs at build time
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
---

<h1>{greeting}</h1>

<style>
  h1 {
    color: purple;
  }
</style>
```

And here's how you'd use a React component with client-side hydration:

```tsx
// Counter.tsx
import { useState } from "react";

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Mathematical Foundations

Astro's performance can be analyzed using complexity theory. The time complexity of static site generation is:

$$
T(n) = O(n \cdot m)
$$

Where $n$ is the number of pages and $m$ is the average component tree depth.

For partial hydration, the JavaScript bundle size follows:

$$
B = \sum_{i=1}^{k} s_i \cdot h_i
$$

Where $s_i$ is the size of component $i$ and $h_i$ is a binary indicator for hydration.

## Conclusion

Astro provides an excellent developer experience while delivering exceptional performance. Its flexibility in choosing frameworks and its smart hydration strategy make it ideal for content-focused websites.
