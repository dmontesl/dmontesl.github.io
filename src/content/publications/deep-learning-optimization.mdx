## Abstract

We propose novel optimization techniques for training deep neural networks that achieve faster convergence while maintaining model quality. Our approach combines adaptive learning rates with gradient clipping strategies, resulting in a 30% reduction in training time across multiple benchmark datasets.

## Key Contributions

1. A new adaptive learning rate schedule that responds to loss landscape curvature
2. Theoretical analysis of convergence guarantees
3. Extensive empirical evaluation on ImageNet and CIFAR-100
